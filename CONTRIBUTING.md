# Share your ReactQL app examples!

If you have an example project that uses ReactQL, and demonstrates key concepts you feel would be useful to other users, then please share!

Simply open a new issue on Github with a link to a public Github repo with runnable code. If accepted as an example, it'll be cloned as an official [reactql organisation](https://github.com/reactql) repository, with you added as a contributor.

## Here are the guidelines:

* Check that a similar project hasn't already been submitted.
* Write a good `README.md` to let users know exactly what your project offers.
* Each project should be a complete ReactQL project, and based on the most recent [ReactQL kit](https://github.com/reactql/kit).
* Must be runnable using the standard `npm i` and `npm start` / `npm run build-run` CLI commands.
* Must be [MIT](LICENSE) licensed, like the main ReactQL kit.
* You will be assigned as a contributor to make changes.
* You authorise the ReactQL to make any changes we deem necessary, including possibly assigning the project to other contributors or changing code.
